        <li>Junior cricket in Bihar</li>
        <p>
          In 1998, Dhoni was selected by Deval Sahay, a former Bihar Cricket
          Association Vice President and Ranchi District Cricket President, to
          play for the Central Coal Fields Limited (CCL) team. Till 1998 Dhoni,
          who was in 12th grade, had never played professional cricket. At CCL,
          he got an opportunity to bat higher up the order, where he performed
          exceptionally, which had helped CCL move to the A division. Deval
          Sahay, impressed by his performance, pushed for his selection in the
          Bihar team. Dhoni moved to the Ranchi team, the junior Bihar cricket
          team and eventually the senior Bihar Ranji Team within one year
        </p>
        <li>Bihar cricket team</li>
        <p>
          Dhoni made his Ranji Trophy debut for Bihar in the 1999–2000 season,
          as an eighteen-year-old. He made a half century in his debut match
          scoring 68* in the second innings against Assam cricket team. Dhoni
          finished the season with 283 runs in 5 matches. Dhoni scored his
          maiden first-class century while playing for Bihar against Bengal in
          the 2000/01 season, this match ended as draw Apart from this century,
          his performance in the 2000/01 season did not include another score
          over fifty and in the 2001/02 season, he scored just five fifties in
          four Ranji matches.
        </p>
        <li>Jharkhand cricket team</li>
        <p>
          Dhoni's performance in the 2002–03 season included three
          half-centuries in the Ranji Trophy and a couple of half-centuries in
          the Deodhar Trophy, as he started gaining recognition for his
          lower-order contribution as well as hard-hitting batting style. In the
          2003/04 season, Dhoni scored a century (128*) against Assam in the
          first match of the Ranji ODI tournament. Dhoni was part of the East
          Zone squad that won the Deodhar Trophy 2003–2004 season and
          contributed with 244 runs in 4 matches, including a century (114)
          against Central zone.
        </p>
        <li>India A team</li>
        <p>
          He was recognised for his efforts in the 2003/04 season, especially in
          the One Day format and was picked for the India A squad for a tour of
          Zimbabwe and Kenya. Against the Zimbabwe XI in Harare Sports Club,
          Dhoni had his best wicket-keeping effort with 7 catches and 4
          stumpings in the match. In the tri-nation tournament involving Kenya,
          India A and Pakistan A, Dhoni helped India A chase down their target
          of 223 against Pakistan A with a half-century. Continuing his good
          performance, he scored back to back centuries – 120 and 119* – against
          the same team. Dhoni scored 362 runs in 6 innings at an average of
          72.40 and his performance in the series received attention from the
          then Indian captain – Sourav Ganguly and Ravi Shastri, amongst others.

      <h2>Our National Hero in International Cricket:</h2>

        <li>Start of ODI cricket:</li>
        <p>
          The Indian ODI team in the early 2000s saw Rahul Dravid as the
          wicket-keeper to ensure that the wicket-keeper spot didn't lack in
          batting talent. The team also saw the entry of wicket-keeper/batsmen
          from the junior ranks, with talents like Parthiv Patel and Dinesh
          Karthik (both India U-19 captains) named in the Test squads. With
          Dhoni making a mark in the India A squad, he was picked in the ODI
          squad for the Bangladesh tour in 2004/05
        </p>
        <li>2007 World Cup</li>
        <p>
          India unexpectedly crashed out of the World Cup after losses to
          Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in the group stage. Dhoni was out for a duck
          in both these matches and scored just 29 runs in the tournament. After
          the loss to Bangladesh in 2007 Cricket World Cup, the house that Dhoni
          was constructing in his home-town Ranchi was vandalised and damaged by
          political activists of JMM. The local police arranged for security for
          his family as India exited the World Cup in the first round
        </p>
        <li>After 2011 World Cup</li>
        <p>
          Winning the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, Dhoni became the first and the
          only captain in international cricket to claim all ICC trophies. In
          the rain-shortened final against England, he was out for a duck and
          ended the tournament with 27 runs from two innings. However, Dhoni's
          field placements and tactics were to India's advantage, as the team
          had beat the opposition by five runs (D/L method). He was also named
          as captain and wicketkeeper of the 'Team of the Tournament' by the ICC
        </p>
        <li>2015 World Cup</li>
        <p>
          During the 2015 Cricket World Cup, Dhoni became the first Indian
          captain to win all group stage matches in such a tournament. India
          achieved wins against arch-rivals Pakistan, South Africa (whom they
          hadn't beaten before in a World Cup game), the UAE, West Indies,
          Ireland and Zimbabwe. In the match against Zimbabwe at Eden Park, he
          made 85 not out chasing 288 and had an unbeaten partnership of 196
          with Suresh Raina.

      <h1>Greatest Achievement: 2011 World Cup Win.</h1>
      <p>
        The 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup was the tenth Cricket World Cup. It was
        played in India, Sri Lanka, and (for the first time) Bangladesh. India
        won the tournament, defeating Sri Lanka by 6 wickets in the final at
        Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, thus becoming the first country to win the
        Cricket World Cup final on home soil. India's Yuvraj Singh was declared
        the man of the tournament. This was the first time in World Cup history
        that two Asian teams had appeared in the final. It was also the first
        time since the 1992 World Cup that the final match did not feature
        Australia .
